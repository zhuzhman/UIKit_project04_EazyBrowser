         The configureWithDefaultBackground makes the navigation bar appear as translucent.

         The main key here is that we are setting the new scrollEdgeAppearance to be the same as standard one.
         This turns off the automatic transparency for all navigation bars in your app, since with the UINavigationBar.appearance()
         we are using the appearance proxy. The code above should ideally go to AppDelegate when the app starts.
